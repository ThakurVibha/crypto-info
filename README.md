## INSPIRATION

Recently I've had a particularly sparked interest in Digital Currency Specifically cryptocurrency.

If you asked me I believe Blockchain Technology might be the Second best invention after the Internet.

However I might be wrong too. When it comes to technology there is always a complexity to determine it's future as things evolve really quick. So pardon me if you read this 10 years from when I wrote and discover I was terriblly wrong. :dizzy_face: My sincerest apologies. :smiley:


**However Lets Talk Code!** :computer:

**This project** came to mind after **Inspiration** by **[Brian Armstrong's](https://github.com/barmstrong)** project **[Bitcoin-Android](https://github.com/barmstrong/bitcoin-android)**. 

I wanted to **challenge myself** with code as I try wrap my head around the **Cryptocurrency world**.

I **believe** I have achieved that but I still have a long way to go in **understanding this masive world** as I strive valiently.


## PRE-REQUISITES.

A couple of things to get you started:

1. Ensure you have [Java](https://java.com/en/download/) installed

A simple way to install Java is using [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/).

Simply follow the instructions to have _sdkman_ installed and install java:

```bash
sdk install java
```

2. [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

Gradle is used as the build tool and can be installed with sdkman:

```bash
sdk install gradle
```

3. [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/)

Android SDK used to provide all the necessary developer tools to build, test, and debug apps for Android in Windows, Mac or Linux.

4. [Android Build Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/build-tools)

Android SDK build tools used to debug, build, run and test an Android application.


### IMPORTANT TERMS TO TAKE NOTE. :smiley:

**Some Basic knowlegde useful to understanding the project or just for fun**

**What is the "Value of Bitcoin" ?**

The ***Value of Bitcoin*** is actually the trust and utility of the Bitcoin network itself. In reality its just worth what someone is willing to pay for it.

**What is "Market Capitalization" and how is it calculated?**

***Market Capitalization*** is one way to rank the relative size of a cryptocurrency. It's calculated by multiplying the Price by the Circulating Supply.

Market Cap = Price X Circulating Supply.

**What is "Circulating Supply"**

***Circulating Supply*** is the best approximation of the number of coins that are circulating in the market and in the general public's hands.

**What is "Total Supply"**

***Total Supply*** is the total amount of coins in existence right now (minus any coins that have been verifiably burned).

- **What is "Max Supply"**

***Max Supply*** is the best approximation of the maximum amount of coins that will ever exist in the lifetime of the cryptocurrency.

- **Why is the Circulating Supply used in determining the market capitalization instead of Total Supply?**
