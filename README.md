- Calculator to covert and calculate cryptocurries to **USD** in using realtime crypto value.
  
## INSPIRATION

Recently I've had a particularly sparked interest in Digital Currency Specifically cryptocurrency.

I believe Blockchain Technology might be the Second best invention after the Internet, also i wanted to learn blaockchain but i need to first master Native android development then i will definitly give it a shot.

**However Lets Talk Code!** :computer:

**This project** came to mind, and i thought that let's build something regarding cryptocurrncies, then i came across several public apis.

I wanted to **challenge myself** with code as I tried to build this app as clean as possible and i will try my best to optimize the code, i have used **Coroutines**, **MVVM**, **Livedata** and other **best practices**.

Further this is not completed yet but i am daily working on this thing.

## PRE-REQUISITES.

A couple of things to get you started:

1. Ensure you have [Java](https://java.com/en/download/) installed

A simple way to install Java is using [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/).

Simply follow the instructions to have _sdkman_ installed and install java:

```bash
sdk install java
```

2. [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

Gradle is used as the build tool and can be installed with sdkman:

```bash
sdk install gradle
```

3. [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/)

Android SDK used to provide all the necessary developer tools to build, test, and debug apps for Android in Windows, Mac or Linux.

### IMPORTANT TERMS TO TAKE NOTE. :smiley:

**Some Basic knowlegde useful to understanding the project or just for fun**

**What is the "Value of Bitcoin" ?**

The ***Value of Bitcoin*** is actually the trust and utility of the Bitcoin network itself. In reality its just worth what someone is willing to pay for it.

**What is "Market Capitalization" and how is it calculated?**

***Market Capitalization*** is one way to rank the relative size of a cryptocurrency. It's calculated by multiplying the Price by the Circulating Supply.

Market Cap = Price X Circulating Supply.

**What is "Circulating Supply"**

***Circulating Supply*** is the best approximation of the number of coins that are circulating in the market and in the general public's hands.

**What is "Total Supply"**

***Total Supply*** is the total amount of coins in existence right now (minus any coins that have been verifiably burned).

- **What is "Max Supply"**

***Max Supply*** is the best approximation of the maximum amount of coins that will ever exist in the lifetime of the cryptocurrency.

- **Why is the Circulating Supply used in determining the market capitalization instead of Total Supply?**
